# Phase Space Format

The allowed columns in the phase space data are defined in the `__phase_space_config.py` file, and are split into
two categories:

1. **Required columns** are, as the name implies, required and present at all times. These are the core data used 
  to represent the phase space; all other data can be derived from these. Each DataLoader must fill in these and only these columns to generate a valid import object.
2. **Allowed columns** can optionally be filled in using a `fill` method on a PhaseSpace object. For instance, to fill the allowed column `Ek [MeV]` you would use the `fill_kinetic_E` method. You are free to update the `allowed_columns` at any time, however in order for the code to pass testing you must:
  1. Write an associated `fill` method
  2. Update the test `test_all_allowed_columns_can_be_filled` inside `test_ParticlePhaseSpace`
  3. Update the "Allowed Columns" documentation below


## Required Columns

| Column name                        | Description                                                  |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| x [mm], y [mm], z [mm]             | The position of each particle in mm                          |
| px [MeV/c], py [MeV/c], pz [MeV/c] | the relativistic momentum of each particle in MeV/c          |
| particle type [pdg_code]           | The particle type, encoded as an integer [pdg code](https://pdg.lbl.gov/2012/mcdata/mc_particle_id_contents.html) |
| weight                             | the statistical weight of each particle. This is used to calculate weighted statistics. In many cases this will be 1 for all particles |
| particle id                        | each particle in the phase space must have a unique integer particle ID |
| time [ps]                          | the time the particle was recorded (in many cases this will be 0 for all particles) |
